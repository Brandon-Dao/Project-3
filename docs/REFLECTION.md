Ai was very helpful for this project. It assisted in generating ideas, writing code 
snippets, and providing explanations for complex concepts. The use of Ai significantly
sped up the development process and improved the overall quality of the documentation.
Several times did i find my self stuck on certain test. For example the test 
listing the top 10 i was stuck on what to change the stream in RowRowRowYourBoat. 
I used claude.ai to help me figure it out. I asked it to analyze the test 
and give me suggestions on how to implement the method. It provided me 
with a clear explanation and code snippet that helped me understand how to 
approach the problem. Finally, when i had completed all the methods my 
ExceptionHandlingTests was throwing errors. And while i was ready to just take it 
to class and ask for help i figured i would try one last time to get Ai to help me.
I asked it to analyze the error messages and provide suggestions on how to fix the tests.
It identified that the exceptions being thrown in the methods did not match the 
exceptions expected in the tests. It suggested changing the exceptions thrown
in the methods to match the test expectations. I made the changes and reran the tests,
and they all passed successfully. Overall, Ai was extremely helpful throughout the project.
