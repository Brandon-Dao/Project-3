# Project 3: Gently Down The Stream - AI-Enhanced Test Driven Development (TDD)

This project combines Test Driven Development (TDD) with AI code analysis to explore advanced Java concepts including exception handling, generics, collections, lambdas, the Stream API, and the Comparable interface.

## Learning Objectives

This refactored project is designed to help you:

1. **Master Test Driven Development**: Given comprehensive unit tests, implement methods to pass all tests
2. **Apply Exception Handling**: Implement robust error handling for edge cases and invalid inputs
3. **Utilize Generics**: Create type-safe collections and methods with proper generic constraints
4. **Leverage Stream API**: Use stream operations with custom collectors and advanced filtering
6. **Practice AI Code Analysis**: Use AI tools to analyze, optimize, and validate your code
7. **Handle Edge Cases**: Write defensive code that gracefully handles null values, empty collections, and invalid parameters

## Module 3 Concepts Covered

* **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions, try-catch blocks, exception propagation
* **Generics**: Type parameters, bounded wildcards, generic methods
* **Collections API**: Advanced collection operations, custom comparators
* **Lambda Expressions**: Functional interfaces, method references, complex lambda chains
* **Stream API**: Intermediate and terminal operations, custom collectors

## Project Overview

You'll implement a comprehensive data processing system that handles various data types and operations while incorporating proper exception handling and advanced Java features. Each method demonstrates different aspects of the Stream API and related concepts.

## Instructions

Complete the project by following these enhanced TDD steps:

1. **Fork and Clone**
    - Download the template from [https://github.com/UltimateSandbox/project-3-initial.git](https://github.com/UltimateSandbox/project-3-initial.git)

2. **AI-Enhanced Analysis Phase**
    - For each method, use an AI assistant to analyze the test code
    - Ask the AI to identify potential edge cases and exception scenarios
    - Request suggestions for robust implementation approaches

3. **Implementation with Exception Handling**
    - In the **GentlyDownTheStream** class, read the TODO comments
    - Examine the corresponding test in **GentlyDownTheStreamTest**
    - Implement methods with proper exception handling and validation
    - Each method should include appropriate null checks and edge case handling

4. **AI Code Review**
    - After implementing each method, use AI tools to review your code
    - Ask for optimization suggestions and potential improvements
    - Validate exception handling approaches

5. **Testing and Validation**
    - You have 10 methods to complete (including exception handling variants)
    - All unit tests must pass, including new exception-focused tests
    - Run additional edge case tests to ensure robustness

## Enhanced Method Requirements

Each method includes:
- **Input validation** with custom exceptions
- **Null safety** checks
- **Generic type safety** where applicable
- **Stream operations**
- **Comprehensive error messages**

## AI Analysis Questions for Students

Before implementing each method, consider these critical questions:

1. What happens if we try to get the first 2 elements from a list with only 1 element?
2. How should we handle the case where no odd numbers exist in topTenUniqueOdd()?
3. What's the best way to handle null elements within a collection?
4. Should average() return null, throw an exception, or return a special value for empty collections?
5. How can we make our exception messages more informative for debugging?
6. What performance considerations should we have for large collections?
7. How can we make our methods more testable and maintainable?

## AI Prompt Templates

Use these specific prompts with your AI assistant:

### **For Code Analysis:**
"I have this Java Stream API method: [paste code]. What edge cases am I missing? What exceptions should I handle? Suggest improvements for robustness."

### **For Exception Strategy:**
"For this data processing method that uses Streams: [paste code]. What's the best exception handling strategy? Should I use checked or unchecked exceptions?"

### **For Performance Review:**
"Review this Stream implementation for performance: [paste code]. Are there any optimizations I should consider? Any Stream operations I should avoid?"

### **Additional Analysis Prompts:**

1. **Code Analysis**: "Analyze this test method and identify all possible edge cases that could cause exceptions. What validation should the implementation include?"

2. **Exception Strategy**: "What types of exceptions should this Stream API method throw? Suggest a robust exception handling strategy."

3. **Performance Review**: "Review this Stream API implementation. Are there any performance optimizations or better approaches?"

4. **Edge Case Identification**: "What edge cases am I missing in this implementation? What additional tests should I write?"

## Submission Requirements
